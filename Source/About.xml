<size=24>Deep Storage Plus: The Deepening</size>

This is an extension mod to Deep Storage, adding a series of storage buildings that are carefully designed and balanced to fit in the gaps of the options provided by LWM's Deep Storage without bloating the Storage tab. Each storage building follows the rule of "more specific = more capacity".

<size=24>Buildings</size>

<b>Organ Fridge</b>: 120 steel, 3 components. Stores up to 16 body parts, 8 per cell. Does not require electricity, because organs don't go bad so there wouldn't be a point. Requires Machining and Air Conditioning to unlock.

<b>Barrel</b>: 120 wood, 25 metallic stuff. Stores up to 8 stacks of one type of liquid (chemfuel, milk, wort, beer, psychite tea, go juice). Also supports Vanilla Expanded Brewing drinks. Other mods can be supported on request. You can only store one kind of liquid in it at a time, because it's a barrel. Requires Complex Furniture to unlock.

<b>Firewood Rack</b>: 60 wood, 150 buildable stuff. Stores up to 14 stacks of wood, 7 per tile. Also prevents deterioration. Requires Complex Furniture to unlock. Due to the rendering method, they look slightly wonky when densely placed, so keep that in mind. Who needs more than a couple thousand wood, anyways.

<b>Bin</b>: 100 buildable stuff. Stores up to 6 stacks of loose resources, but is faster to use than the skip. Can also only store one type of item at a time. Currently supports raw food, raw plants, textiles, drugs, pemmican, kibble, herbal medicine. Open to adding more items on request. Requires Machining to unlock.
